        Looking back at the group work we did together in Assignment 2 it is
        easy to understand why the phrase “hindsight is a beautiful thing” is
        so often used. As our first group assignment I believe we worked well
        together but we were not without our problems. It’s not easy to
        co-ordinate an assignment and all of its complex parts. Bringing
        together a group of people who have not worked together before and who
        also had various time limits to commit to the assignment due to work
        and life balances, sometimes proved challenging.

        Assignment 2 was a comprehensive project that required research,
        particularly into technologies we had no prior knowledge of, and we
        needed to have it delivered within a specified time frame. We were all
        committed to doing it to the best of our ability. Some in our group
        were available to brainstorm our project during the day and some were
        only available quite late in the evening and even then, had limited
        time due to responsibilities with their families. This resulted in some
        members only seeing the progress of the group a few days after the
        others had already completed their part of the project. In hindsight,
        we should have made allowances for the availability of time for some of
        our team members and thought about how their tasks could be completed
        given their time limits.

        Moving on to Assignment 3, I expect it to be a much easier process now
        that we've gotten to know each other and have worked together so well
        in our first group assignment. We know how to assign tasks and who has
        the ability and time to do each of the tasks that we have allocated to
        team members. We’ve tried to make certain that all our team have
        contributed to each part of the project by pairing up team members and
        having this rotate in each section of the project so that every member
        is having input into each part of the Assignment. We have also been
        able to ascertain the strengths of some team members. Some of our team
        members are more confident in project management, others like writing,
        some are very interested in Web page development and others in
        animation and video editing. We are communicating well as a team and
        are confident in our ability to complete this project together and at a
        very high standard.
