		<h1 id="Group">Group processes</h1>
      <p> Looking back at the group work we did together in Assignment 2 it is
        easy to understand why the phrase “hindsight is a beautiful thing” is
        so often used. As our first group assignment I believe we worked well
        together but we were not without our problems. It’s not easy to
        co-ordinate an assignment and all of its complex parts. Bringing
        together a group of people who have not worked together before and who
        also had various time limits to commit to the assignment due to work
        and life balances, sometimes proved challenging.
    </p>
    <p> Assignment 2 was a comprehensive project that required research,
        particularly into technologies we had no prior knowledge of, and we
        needed to have it delivered within a specified time frame. We were all
        committed to doing it to the best of our ability. Some in our group
        were available to brainstorm our project during the day and some were
        only available quite late in the evening and even then, had limited
        time due to responsibilities with their families. This resulted in some
        members only seeing the progress of the group a few days after the
        others had already completed their part of the project. In hindsight,
        we should have made allowances for the availability of time for some of
        our team members and thought about how their tasks could be completed
        given their time limits.
    </p>
    <p> Moving on to Assignment 3, I expect it to be a much easier process now
        that we've gotten to know each other and have worked together so well
        in our first group assignment. We know how to assign tasks and who has
        the ability and time to do each of the tasks that we have allocated to
        team members. We’ve tried to make certain that all our team have
        contributed to each part of the project by pairing up team members and
        having this rotate in each section of the project so that every member
        is having input into each part of the Assignment. We have also been
        able to ascertain the strengths of some team members. Some of our team
        members are more confident in project management, others like writing,
        some are very interested in Web page development and others in
        animation and video editing. We are communicating well as a team and
        are confident in our ability to complete this project together and at a
        very high standard.

        While completing A1, my career plan was aimed in the direction of
        developer roles. That role initially seemed challenging and interesting
        but as A2 commenced and further research took place, this direction
        diverted towards the Solutions Architect world. This role would have
        allowed me to combine both my business and project coordination skills
        with eventually the tech skills learned and obtained throughout the
        course and beyond. Since moving into A3, this direction has again
        changed. The realisation that a career in the backend of IT isn’t a
        passion and only an interest has been made clear. My path is more
        focussed on the design of things rather than the technical aspects. A
        career in managing creative design projects and learning in-depth about
        mobile app design seems to be more in line with my passions. Heading
        forward, a career in UI and UX design or game design makes more sense.

        When researching my ideal job in A1 assignment, I looked at what jobs
        were available in northern Tasmania, and in the area that I lived, and
        what my experience and skill base in management and communication would
        allow me to be successful in my application. At the time information
        and communication technology manager was a role I could obtain and be
        successful in.

        When I think about what I enjoy about technology, it's the creative
        side leaning more towards the graphic designer, directing videos,
        editing and adding animations, look at the way the videos flow, are
        they telling a story? Well, there might not be many graphic designer
        jobs in Tassie, but it's an area I'm now going to focus on, and my next
        steps will be in this direction regardless of where I live.

        When I first started thinking about an ideal job for A1, I instantly
        thought of a job that was being advertised in the company I already
        work for. I thought that would be a great job for me as I already know
        the people in the company and have worked for there since 1994. Fairly
        quickly after completing A1 I realised that I wasn’t particularly
        interested in being an IT support person after all. This has come about
        partly due to completing the weekly reading and tasks in the
        Introduction to Technology course but also from interacting with my
        classmates. My true interests lie in illustration and playing video
        games and I think I would like to work as a graphic designer, creating
        video game characters for games that I love to play.

        When I thought about my ideal job in A1 assignment, the most important
        factor that I kept in consideration was the career prospects of a data
        analyst in the future. As IT plays a major role in so many business
        areas, I expect data management will still be a promising job as a
        career. Especially, data management using SQL. This has proven to be in
        demand according to the burning glass data from Assignment 2. I do not
        have any prior experience in data management nor SQL language, but I am
        willing to learn and delve into in-depth IT field studies.

                    Today's world has evolved to embrace the new industrial
                    revolution. Our workplaces are changing. The same as how
                    the other industrial revolutions transformed the skillset
                    and experience required from the workforce; we can expect
                    the same from this revolution. Only five years from now, 35

       <p>
        OTOD Tech have communicated using Microsoft Teams with twice weekly
        recorded video meetings and all files uploaded to the Files channels in
        the Teams App. We have used a group Word template document in Teams
        that everyone has access to as a draft for our Assignment with everyone
        working on sections independently and then uploading to this document
        for other Team members to review.
    </p>
    <p>
        All team members are required to attend every meeting. If they cannot
        attend a meeting or need a meeting time to be rescheduled, they must
        let everyone know prior to the meeting so that another time can be
        agreed upon. If a team member does not attend a meeting or becomes
        inactive, all team members will reach out to them to check if all is
        well and if the team member doesn’t respond, we will then email our
        Course instructors to let them know that a team member has gone missing
        and ask for an update on the activity of the inactive team member.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have found this to be the perfect method of communication for our
        Team.
