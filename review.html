          <h3>Team Member 1</h3>
         <div>
    <p>
        After the initial confusion around the requirements of this assignment
        and the delays in receiving clear guidance, I felt somewhat on the
        backfoot and a little worried about meeting the due date. Luckily for
        me, my team included four extremely strong and capable members and we
        came together and planned out the project efficiently and effectively
        by breaking down the requirements into manageable tasks and assigned
        each task to match the strengths of each member.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        <em>What went well </em>
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        Our communication was stronger than it was in A2. We had a better
        understanding of each other and how we worked as team. I was able to
        plot out the initial plan using a Gantt chart without worrying if the
        tasks were going to be completed on time. Each member was assigned
        their sections and we went away and worked on them and provided status
        checks during each of our weekly meetings.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        What could be improved
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        I understand that there is always room for improvement, but in this
        case, we worked extremely well together, and I always felt like someone
        had my back. We all had unexpected life curve balls thrown at us during
        this project and my team members were there to jump in and pick-up the
        slack, particularly when again, we lost another team member without
        notice during week 3 of the project. This left us feeling a little
        deflated and confused but we came together, allocated the shortfall and
        got to work on the project. Under the circumstances, I couldn’t have
        asked for a better team.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        <em>At least one thing surprising </em>
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        How well we continued to work together. By this time, many teams tend
        to show signs of issues, yes, we lost a member, and we still don’t know
        the reason, but the rest of us, communicated and kept each other
        motivated to get the project done.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        What also surprised me, was how much effort we all put into supporting
        the team member that left, and still we received no explanation for why
        they abandoned the project. This behaviour I find extremely
        unprofessional, but I also understand that each member deals with their
        own issues in their own way.

        <em>One thing I have learned about groups </em>
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        That everyone has their own strengths and if you lucky enough to
        attract the right balance of people and personalities and everyone is
        dedicated to working hard and producing high standards of work, you
        can’t fail.

          <h3>Team Member 2</h3>
          <div>
    <p>
        There is no doubt about it, this is a good team. After many weeks of
        working together we feel comfortable and trust each other, and I
        believe everyone felt they were able to have an equal amount of input
        into the projects we’ve been working on. I genuinely feel like I would
        like to work on further projects with each team member in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>What went well</em>
        <br/>
    </p>
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        Continuing on from our A2, OTOD Tech group communicated very well with
        twice weekly team meetings and catch up’s during the week for
        clarification on various aspects of the project. I was excited to show
        the other team members what I had been working on since we last met up
        and was keen for their input. This goes to show how truly comfortable
        we’ve become with each other. Also, each team member has a great sense
        of humour and we all have similar interests, so we always had something
        to talk about.
    </p>
</div>

        <em>What could be improved </em>
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        I am struggling to find anything that we could improve on in our group.
        The main issue was when we lost another team member without notice and
        I believe it was completely out of our hands. We did spend a lot of
        time reflecting on why another team member would leave, but we all felt
        like we had reached out to this team member numerous times to try to
        find out why they left but didn’t have any luck. We all wish this team
        member well.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        At least one thing that was surprising
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        As we are close to finalising our assignments, I am surprised at how
        sad I am at not being able to work together as a team in the future. I
        would like to do some further study in the future but would only really
        like to continue with this same group. I have found as I started
        preparing for a solo assignment without my team, that I’m not looking
        forward to it now as much as I was when I first started this course. I
        feel like we work better as a group, and I love hearing everyone’s
        perspective on the different aspects of our assignments.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        <em>At least one thing that you have learned about groups </em>
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        I learned that groups are essential. I would have always believed I
        worked better alone. It is so much easier not to have to worry about
        other people, what they’re doing and how they’re completing their
        tasks. The opposite is true - I found working in a group enhanced my
        own skills. I learnt so much from each and every team member. If I felt
        low and couldn’t get motivated, I instantly thought of how hard
        everyone was working and I didn’t want to let them down, so I tried
        harder. Working in a group was a huge learning curve and now I cannot
        imagine working any other way.

            <h1>Tools & Audit Trail</h1>
            <h3>GitHub</h3>
            <p>The GitHub audit trail is a true reflection of our teams work efforts. Though the commit history is subjective, as it depends on what the commits represents, i.e. one member making many mistakes or one member adding quality code? Either way, we were all still learning to strengthen our commit processes and our way around GitHub in general. Some team member's were more confident with it but having other members less confident resulted in apprehension and sometimes errors, but it was all a learning curve which we managed to overcome to a point, and eventually found our groove resulting in what we believe to be a very successful website and something we were all proud to be part of.</p>
            <p>Do we all now love GitHub after this experience? The jury is still it out.</p>

            </ul>
            <p>We found MS Teams the perfect tool to manage and coordinate our team. It provided a Task Planner which we transferred all of our Group Schedule (Gantt Chart) tasks into and assigned each task to members of the team. These were tracked with due dates and followed up during our meetings. Some team members had little experience with Teams but did an amazing job to get up to speed and appreciate the features of the program.</p>

            <p>Our Team consisted of the following channels:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>General</li>
              <li>GitHub and Website</li>
              <li>Interesting Leaning Links</li>
              <li>Meetings</li>
              <li>Project Brainstorming</li>
              <li>Project Management</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This made it easier to find relevant chat threads and other information relating to the specific area of our project.</p>

            <p>Our online meetings were successful and without too many connectivity issues. We were able to easily share our screens, swap control and record. The recordings were easy to store as well as all of the other documents required to complete our project.</p>

            <p>Below are two of the tracking charts from the Task Planner. These are a true representation of the contributions of each team member:</p>
