          <h3>Team Member 1</h3>
         <div>
    <p>
        After the initial confusion around the requirements of this assignment
        and the delays in receiving clear guidance, I felt somewhat on the
        backfoot and a little worried about meeting the due date. Luckily for
        me, my team included four extremely strong and capable members and we
        came together and planned out the project efficiently and effectively
        by breaking down the requirements into manageable tasks and assigned
        each task to match the strengths of each member.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        <em>What went well </em>
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        Our communication was stronger than it was in A2. We had a better
        understanding of each other and how we worked as team. I was able to
        plot out the initial plan using a Gantt chart without worrying if the
        tasks were going to be completed on time. Each member was assigned
        their sections and we went away and worked on them and provided status
        checks during each of our weekly meetings.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
      <em>   What could be improved </em>
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        I understand that there is always room for improvement, but in this
        case, we worked extremely well together, and I always felt like someone
        had my back. We all had unexpected life curve balls thrown at us during
        this project and my team members were there to jump in and pick-up the
        slack, particularly when again, we lost another team member without
        notice during week 3 of the project. This left us feeling a little
        deflated and confused but we came together, allocated the shortfall and
        got to work on the project. Under the circumstances, I couldn’t have
        asked for a better team.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        <em>At least one thing surprising </em>
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        How well we continued to work together. By this time, many teams tend
        to show signs of issues, yes, we lost a member, and we still don’t know
        the reason, but the rest of us, communicated and kept each other
        motivated to get the project done.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        What also surprised me, was how much effort we all put into supporting
        the team member that left, and still we received no explanation for why
        they abandoned the project. This behaviour I find extremely
        unprofessional, but I also understand that each member deals with their
        own issues in their own way.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
       <p>
        <em>One thing I have learned about groups </em>
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        That everyone has their own strengths and if you lucky enough to
        attract the right balance of people and personalities and everyone is
        dedicated to working hard and producing high standards of work, you
        can’t fail.
    </p>
</div>

</div>
          <h3>Team Member 2</h3>
          <div>
    <p>
        There is no doubt about it, this is a good team. After many weeks of
        working together we feel comfortable and trust each other, and I
        believe everyone felt they were able to have an equal amount of input
        into the projects we’ve been working on. I genuinely feel like I would
        like to work on further projects with each team member in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>What went well</em>
        <br/>
    </p>
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        Continuing on from our A2, OTOD Tech group communicated very well with
        twice weekly team meetings and catch up’s during the week for
        clarification on various aspects of the project. I was excited to show
        the other team members what I had been working on since we last met up
        and was keen for their input. This goes to show how truly comfortable
        we’ve become with each other. Also, each team member has a great sense
        of humour and we all have similar interests, so we always had something
        to talk about.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
        <p>
        <em>What could be improved </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        I am struggling to find anything that we could improve on in our group.
        The main issue was when we lost another team member without notice and
        I believe it was completely out of our hands. We did spend a lot of
        time reflecting on why another team member would leave, but we all felt
        like we had reached out to this team member numerous times to try to
        find out why they left but didn’t have any luck. We all wish this team
        member well.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
      <em>   At least one thing that was surprising </em>
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        As we are close to finalising our assignments, I am surprised at how
        sad I am at not being able to work together as a team in the future. I
        would like to do some further study in the future but would only really
        like to continue with this same group. I have found as I started
        preparing for a solo assignment without my team, that I’m not looking
        forward to it now as much as I was when I first started this course. I
        feel like we work better as a group, and I love hearing everyone’s
        perspective on the different aspects of our assignments.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        <em>At least one thing that you have learned about groups </em>
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        I learned that groups are essential. I would have always believed I
        worked better alone. It is so much easier not to have to worry about
        other people, what they’re doing and how they’re completing their
        tasks. The opposite is true - I found working in a group enhanced my
        own skills. I learnt so much from each and every team member. If I felt
        low and couldn’t get motivated, I instantly thought of how hard
        everyone was working and I didn’t want to let them down, so I tried
        harder. Working in a group was a huge learning curve and now I cannot
        imagine working any other way.
    </p>
</div>
          
          <h3>Team Member 3</h3>
          <p>
    <em>What went well </em>
    <em> </em>
    <em></em>
</p>
<p>
    What went well in our team was the synergy of the OTOD Tech Team, which we
    had built up over A2, and continued throughout A3 &amp; A5, all four of us
    working together, each confident in the other, knowing that if any of us
    needed support, it was there. While working on this assignment, each of us
    had a personal problem, and we all pulled together to support one
    another—each of us helping where we could. We could rely on each other to
    get the job done.
</p>
<p>
    <em>What could be improved </em>
</p>
<p>
    It’s hard to pinpoint anything we could have improved on as each of us was
    carrying an extra workload due to us being two team members down.
</p>
<p>
    Everyone worked extremely hard to produce high-quality work for this
    assignment.
</p>
<p>
    <em>At least one thing that was surprising </em>
    <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
    The only thing that I found surprising is that we lost another team member.
    I feel the whole team was going out of their way to help and support this
    individual. I can genuinely say that I was sad that they left, as I felt
    like we had developed a genuine bond of understanding and trust. For him to
    just disappear without explanation was just disappointing. I wish him well
    whatever he is doing in life.
</p>
<p>
    <em>At least one thing that you have learned about groups </em>
    <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
    One thing that I’ve learnt about groups is that a good one is hard to find.
    When you find a good group, it feels like everyone is a piece of the same
    jigsaw puzzle. Everyone listens to each other, giving feedback, Help and
    support, to produce great work. Those bonds in a team can become
    unbreakable, and I’m genuinely sad that my time with this team is nearly
    finished. I will cherish my time working with and being a part of the OTOD
    Tech team.

            <p><p>
    <em>What went well </em>
    <em> </em>
    <em></em>
</p>
<p>
    We believe that the entire OTOD Tech team collaborated well as a group and
    worked diligently to complete our assignment on time. We displayed
    excellent organisational, time-management, and communication skills. As in
    A2 we created a detailed 'Group Project Schedule' (Gantt Chart) and
    assigned our tasks via MS Teams' Task Planner.
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    During each of our meetings, we made sure to set realistic deadlines and
    check on their progress. Our overall deadline was set a week before the
    deadline to allow everyone enough time to review and make any last-minute
    changes.
</p>
<p>
    The links in the Tools &amp; Audit Trail section below provide a detailed
    description of how our team worked and how much each person contributed.
</p>
<p>
    <em>What could be improved </em>
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    We lost another team member. It goes without saying that having the input
    of another team member could have improved our overall work. Having extra
    perspectives from various members is invaluable, and their contribution is
    something that could have helped us plan and develop better. Who knows what
    that extra team member could have added to our project. Every one of our
    group is a valued member of our team and we wish we would have been able to
    get an explanation of why this team member left us without notification.
</p>
<p>
    <em>At least one thing that was surprising </em>
    <em> </em>
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    Being a member of this team is similar to being a member of an exclusive
    club. It has felt like our team has been up against the world at times. We
    all had individual personal problems to contend with but at the end of the
    day, we were all working to make our app Pups &amp; Kids the best possible
    and viable app it could be.
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    <em>At least one thing that you have learned about groups </em>
    <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
    It's great to be recognised, but it's even better when the whole team is
    recognised so you can really rejoice without feeling self-conscious. That's
    exactly what we learned about working together in a group. When we all pull
    together we all win and our ultimate goal was to make an app that was
    something we were all proud of.
    <br/>

            <h1>Tools & Audit Trail</h1>
            <h3>GitHub</h3>
            <p>
    The GitHub audit trail is a true reflection of our teams work efforts. Due
    to the time commitments required to populate the website, design and create
    a prototype of the app and produce and edit a video for A5, we allocated
    specific sections of the project to balance the workload of each task.
    Peter focussed on the A5, Jenaya focussed on the design and prototyping of
    the app and Meagan and JJ focussed on the website and promo site, hence why
    the commit history is favoured more toward Meagan and JJ. This isn't saying
    anyone did less toward the project it just indicates what team members were
    focussed on their own sections of the project.
