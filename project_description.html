      <h1 id="Aims">Aim</h1>
      <p>Our aim is to develop a mobile application that is designed to help educate parents and their children about the importance of socialising their new puppy in the hope of lessening the chances of behavioural issues developing in the future. By creating this application, parents will be able to conveniently and efficiently access the necessary socialisation techniques for their puppy while at the same time engaging their young children through the fun and easy activities created by the application. This will allow parents to find a balance between the needs of their puppy and child during the ‘critical period’ of socialisation that all puppies need within their first 16 weeks of age. The application will be designed to work on both iOS and Android operating systems to increase the user reach of the application.</p>
      <h1>Goals</h1>
      <ol>
          <li><strong>Research and determine the requirements of socialising a puppy and how to engage and teach young children</strong>.This will include consulting a qualified dog trainer and behaviourist and an early childhood specialist to ascertain the developmental needs and learning patterns of both puppy and child.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Research and determine the features of the mobile application that will be the most relevant and beneficial for parents to find a balance when socialising a puppy and raising children.</strong>From the research obtained in Goal 1, this will allow the team to include features that capture the attention span of both puppy and child.  Features that are easy to use by parents, and by children aged from toddler to ten years old and provide the adequate socialising exercise and techniques suitable for puppies up until 16 weeks of age. There are many features that could be added to this application, but after discussions with the team, we believe that the most beneficial features would be:</li>
          <br>
          <ul>
              <li>A tailored 16-week socialisation plan that is automatically broken down into step-by-step daily tasks and scheduled via the calendar. Each task will be adjustable according to the weather requirements to lessen chances of days missed.</li>
              <br>
              <li>Daily push notifications to the parent’s phone to remind them of the daily socialisation requirements.</li>
              <br>
              <li>Progress achievements rewarded in the form of completion badges to keep parents and children engaged due to feeling a sense of accomplishment.</li>
              <br>
              <li>Developmental chart, images and explanation of the puppy’s needs throughout the 16 weeks.</li>
              <br>
              <li>Video demonstrations of how to socialise a puppy in-house and in other environments.</li>
              <br>
              <li>Social networking feature to connect parents with other families to provide a support network and ability to organise “puppy parties” to help socialise their puppies in a group environment.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Produce a prototype of the mobile application suitable for both parents and children. </strong>The prototype will be created using Figma and will be designed for the parent, as the main person to socialise the puppy but will include a child-friendly section that has games and activities with images, icons and a colour scheme that engages the child. This will help the parent have something tangible to show the children to keep them involved in the responsibilities of having a puppy.</li>
      </ol>
      <h1 id="Plans and Progress">Plans and Progress</h1>
     <p><strong>How it Began</strong></p>
      <p>During 2019 – 2020, according to the RSPCA, there were over 29 million pets in Australia (RSPCA, 2020), with 40% being dogs. It is estimated that Australians spend about $13 billion per year on their four-legged family members. According to Canstar, the average person dedicates around $13,000 to their dog over the course of its life (Canstar, 2017). This includes food, vet care, toys, pet insurance and so on. What tends not to be a priority, is puppy socialisation and training and this can lead to behavioural issues in the future.</p>
      <p>The majority of the population know very little about dog behaviour, which is a serious issue because people ignore the signs and push dogs over threshold, which can result in someone being bitten which ends with the dog being taken to the vet or pound and likely killed. Research conducted in 2012-2013 discovered that approximately 211,655 dogs end up in pounds, and of that, approximately 43,900 are killed (21%). (Chua, Rand & Morton 2017). The main reason dogs end up in or don't get out of a pound is due to behavioural issues.</p>
      <p>Some owners will attend a four-week puppy class, which are often run in vet clinics by unqualified trainers such as vet nurses. The classes tend to cover more vet related topics rather than behavioural needs and the importance of positive socialisation within the puppy's first 16 weeks of life ('The Critical Period of Socialisation'). A class like this also tends to advise owners not to take their puppies out of the home until they've had all three vaccinations, which is detrimental to the puppy's development. Then, by the time the puppy class is over, the puppy is beyond 16 weeks of age, and the Critical period is over. A puppy's ability to socialise efficiently and effectively, beyond this point, diminishes by the day. The first year of a puppy's life is the most important. It's when owners need to set strong foundations of socialisation and training during this time.</p>
      <p>With parents needing to focus on a puppy’s socialisation as well as raising a toddler or young child, it can make the process of raising a puppy ten times harder and without the required knowledge and training skills, this often results in frustration targeted at the puppy and the puppy being either rehomed or dumped in a pound later in life when the behaviour issues have begun to show.</p>
      <p>Then Covid-19 hit and lockdowns across the world, resulted in many family’s impulse buying puppies not understanding that the first 16 weeks are the critical time to get puppies out and about to positively experience the world and all its sights and sounds it has to offer. Nobody was allowed out. Now we’re seeing those same families, dumping those puppies in pounds and shelters, either because they’re no longer able to work from home, or they’ve gone back to work and their now one year old puppy has developed separation anxiety and ripping the house apart or barking all day, or due to no socialisation, the puppy is fear biting or is a neurotic mess whenever someone new comes in the house or they hear a unknown sound coming from outside.</p>
      <p>The ‘Pups & Kids’ mobile application is to provide parents with easily accessible resources to help socialise their puppy as well as have access to activities targeted at the children to involve them in the training. It will give the parents ways to keep their puppy and children engaged during the 16 weeks period of socialisation inside the house and beyond.</p>
      <p>References</p>
      <p>ADD REFERENCES</p>
       <p><strong>Project Progress</strong></p>
       <p>After speaking to other animal advocates and dog trainers about this issue, we discovered that there is a very little amount of puppy socialisation resources solely marketed to families with puppies. There are many puppy and dog training applications and websites but nothing that incorporates the needs of the parents, the child, and the puppy, resulting in a cohesive plan that benefits the whole family and makes raising a puppy less of a burden and more of a privilege.</p>
       <p>Early discussions involved creating a website with videos and resources but that’s been done many times over plus accessing a computer isn’t always convenient. The idea to create a mobile application was decided when it was discovered that there are over 3 billion smartphone users worldwide (Statista, 2020), plus parents are often on the go, either outside playing with their children and puppies or inside picking up after them, so it just made sense. By choosing this design medium, it will make the required training information and techniques accessible anywhere, for socialising inside the home and outside of it. This would be the only puppy socialisation app on the market solely designed for parents raising young children.</p>
       <p>The idea was further confirmed when we heard about a veterinarian who had been contacted by a mother who wanted to put her eight-month-old puppy to “sleep” (euthanised) because the puppy was nipping her children and peeing all around the house and chewing her shoes and the TV remote. She had gone on to say that if she’d known how much work a puppy was going to be, she would never had gotten one while her three boys were so young (all under the age of seven). The vet asked her if she’d done any training with the puppy. The mother had said, she just didn’t have the time. Luckily, the vet refused to kill the puppy and instead called a local animal rescue organisation that just happened to be run by two dog trainers. That puppy is now twelve months old and very well trained.</p>
       <p>The need for accessible socialisation resources for families with puppies is evident by the number of dog’s abandoned each year due to avoidable behavioural issues. So, the team at OTOD Tech got to work and commenced planning the first phase of creating such an app.</p>
        <p><strong>Market Research</strong></p>
        <p>After the initial planning during week 1, like scope, roles and required tasks, the team decided during the second week of the project to contact some local vets and dog training schools to find out what their clients pain points were. This resulted in learning that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Parents had little to no knowledge of the importance of socialising their puppy or about dog behaviour in general.</li>
            <li>They did no researching or planning around the requirements of having a puppy prior to bring one into their family. They didn’t realise how much work it takes.</li>
            <li>Parents found it hard to find a good balance between raising their children and socialising their puppy adequately.</li>
            <li>They tended not to complete a full 6-week training course due to prioritising their children’s needs and extra curriculum over the puppy’s.</li>
            <li>They often wished that someone else could train their puppy for them or that training could be fun and easier.</li>
            <li>Parents would like to be able to involve their children more with the training to help create a stronger sense of responsibility and a caring nature in their child.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The team also contacted some local shelters and learned that the average age of a dog dumped in the pound is three years old. The main reason that a dog ends up in the pound is due to behaviour issues and the most common excuse is “change in circumstances”.  During this week, the team also created a simple questionnaire that incorporated the above points. This questionnaire was sent out to the OTOD Tech team members individual networks, which resulted in forty-eight applicants submitting their feedback. Apart from some background info, the questionnaires posed the following question:</p>
        <ul>
            <em>"Would the creation of a mobile application that helped parents socialise their puppies while raising young children, be beneficial to them or someone they knew? and if so, would they purchase it and if not, why not?"</em>
        </ul>
        <p>The questionnaire resulted with 85% positive feedback.</p>
        <p><strong>Target Demographic</strong></p>
        <p>Our target demographic is young parents with young children with a young pup or two. This demographic is mainly made up of millennials and this age range access the majority of their information from their smartphones and approximately 90% of their time is spent on apps. These users also want an app that is easy to navigate, enjoyable to use, efficient and boosts productivity.</p>
        <p>We want to design an app that makes life easier for parents and puppies. Making access to the required information efficient and intuitive will be an important part of our design.</p>
        <p>ADD GRAPH & REFERENCE</p>
        <p><strong>Current Status</strong></p>
        <p>The first round of research conducted, helped the team determine that the project was feasible and would in fact help solve a common problem faced by parents and dogs, globally. It also allowed the team to understand what requirements and features to include in the scope of the project to make the mobile application the most helpful to families.</p>
        <p>We evaluated the main expectation of the app and referred to our scope and aim. This saw the venture into creating an algorithm put on the backburner and added to phase two of the development of the project. Due to time constraints and lack of budget, the project originally had a large number of goals and features that we wanted to include. But considering our time constraint of 6 weeks we brainstormed and decided on the ‘must have’ features opposed to the ‘Wishlist’ features:</p>
        <p>ADD TABLE</p>
        <h3><em><strong>Competitive Analysis</strong></em></h3>
        <p>We researched more on what applications are on the market to get a feel of how our application would fair against them, taking into consideration the features they included, how they organised information and flow, and the user interface and how that affected the user experience.</p>
        <p>There are two main contenders:</p>
        <p>ADD PUPFORD IMAGE</p>
        <p><strong>Pupford</strong> is a dog training application that is designed to run on both iOS and Android operating systems.  The interface is intuitive, clean and easy to use. It’s not cluttered and overwhelming. Any user could pick it up and make sense of it. Besides the red, their colour scheme is very similar to our own design.</p>
        <p>ADD APP STORE LINKS</p>
        <p>Their website reads:</p>
        <ul>
            <em><p><strong>96% of Dogs Relinquished to Shelters Have Received ZERO Formal Training.</strong></p>
            <p>In an effort to reduce that terrible statistic, I've teamed up with Pupford to provide this comprehensive dog training to the entire world, all for free. (Free Dog Training App | Pupford n.d.)</p></em>
            <em><p>When we train our dogs, we create stronger and more powerful relationships with them. Dogs are instinctively programmed to learn skills from humans. When we tap into those instincts, you end up with a dog that is more loyal, happier, and ready for whatever situations may come his or her way. Training your dog is an investment in the health and happiness of your pup, and of course, a way to achieve peace of mind when your pup is around new people, children, or other dogs. This free training is geared to help thousands of dog parents, as well as to help reduce the number of dogs that end up in shelters. (Free Dog Training App | Pupford n.d.)</p></em>
        </ul>
        <p>The team at Pupford have a very similar motivation to us. They’re not wanting to make loads of money; they just want to help dogs avoid being dumped in pounds. Their app is intended for all ages of dogs, from young puppies and throughout their life cycle. What it doesn’t do, is factor parents lack of time and need for being able to balance the socialisation needs of their puppy and activity levels of their children. The application is also more focussed on obedience rather than in-depth socialisation examples and demonstrations. What they do have is access to Zak George, a well-respected a dog trainer with scientifically evidenced experience and qualifications with a large YouTube following. Something that our team may look into in future planning of the application.</p>
        <p>ADD REFERENCES</p>
        <p>ADD GOODPUP IMAGE</p>
        <p><strong>GoodPup</strong> is a dog training application that runs of iOS and Android. The interface and overall flow of this application is good though a little more cluttered with chats and pics etc.</p>
        <p>ADD APP STORE LINKS</p>
        <p>Their website reads:</p>
        <ul>
            <em><p>Bringing home a new puppy can be a challenging and stressful time. At GoodPup, we help build the foundation for a successful relationship between a new puppy parent and their new best friend. We do this through personalized dog training courses delivered at home through 1:1 video calls, 24/7 chat with trainers, and guided practice. GoodPup is the top rated dog training app in the App Store (4.9 stars, 5k+ reviews) and we’re growing rapidly. (GoodPup - Dog Training Over Live Video Chat n.d.)</p></em>
        </ul>
        <p>This application is focussed on puppies and dogs but more around basic obedience and health. Once again, there doesn’t seem to be a structure plan to ensure adequate socialisation foundations are met. They provide one-on-one training with dog trainers via an online platform. They use reward based training which provides scientifically proven techniques. There is no clear motivation for their application but they do offer a week free then they do charge a fee plus possible extra fees around access to trainers and costs of each session. They claim to have qualified trainers and their Facebook page provides numerous positive reviews.</p>
        <p>Our team also has access to qualified trainers who use reward based, force-free techniques. What our team can learn from this app, is to utilise social media to promote and test our application, moving into the future planning.</p>
        <p>ADD REFERENCES</p>
         <h3><strong>Wireframes</strong></h3>
         <p>As we began our basic layout idea, we got to work designing low fidelity wireframes to provide a simple jumping off point for when it came to creating the actual layout and colours of the application. We knew we wanted it to be a Native UI design so it was easy to navigate.</p>
         <p>ADD WIREFRAME IMAGES</p>
         <h3><strong>Design</strong></h3>
         <p>As we are marketing to families with young children and aiming to incorporate games and child friendly activities, we wanted to keep the design simple in layout, intuitive, and easy to navigate. By incorporating bright colours this will enable the app to engage the children.</p>
         <p>ADD COLOUR PALETTE IMAGE</p>
         <p>We ensured that the colours chosen were also colour blind safe. As of 2018, around 549, 000 Australian’s are colour blind (Eye health, How common is visual impairment? n.d.). It is important to OTOD Tech that our design is accessible by as many users as possible.</p>
         <p>ADD COLOUR WHEEL IMAGE</p>
         <p>ADD REFERENCES</p>
         <p>By referring to our low fidelity wireframes and reviewing our chosen colour scheme, the team moved forwarded with Figma to create some high fidelity versions to give us a sense of what our design would look like incorporating the colours and basic layout. Though the colours changed slightly, we stuck to our first plan of having vibrant, engaging colours that both parents and children would enjoy. The layout stayed simple and easy to navigate with little to no clutter.</p>
         <p>ADD FIGMA DESIGN SCREENSHOTS</p>
         <h3><strong>User Flow</strong></h3>
         <p>We initially started with a wireframe of the user flow then move forward to develop a high fidelity version. After further discussions with the team we put together a basic interactive user flow to make sure our design was how we pictured it. We learned that we need to direct most pages back to the dashboard and that pages like the reset password, edit profile page etc were missing. We updated our design and included the missing screens.</p>
         <p>ADD WIREFRAME USER FLOW IMAGE</p>
         <p>ADD HIGH FIDELITY USER FLOW ONBOARDING IMAGE</p>
          <p>ADD HIGH FIDELITY MAIN USER FLOW IMAGE</p>
          <p>All of the screens include a ‘Back’ button and ‘Menu’ plus the bottom menu on each screen include a ‘Home’ button. In the original design, we included in the bottom menu a button to the ‘Games’ and ‘Badges’ page. After requesting some feedback from a few personal contacts about the design, we took on their suggestions and the bottom menu ended up including the following ‘Home’, Message (Puppy Network)’, ‘Calendar’ (Daily Socialisation Plan), ‘Upload’ and ‘Settings’. We tried to make the design as simple as possible taking into consideration that parents may hand their phone to their children to play the games. With children practically being raised by technology these days, the design could be easily used by most children from ages 3 – 10 years old.</p>
        <h3><strong>Prototype</strong></h3>
        <p>As our project has evolved and developed, and with the limited time afforded to us due to a team member leaving without notice, our prototype isn’t as interactive as we’d have liked i.e. dropdowns, swipe feature, animations etc, are not quite in place. We worked as hard as we could with the basic design and prototyping skills that we had but we are all very proud of our end result. We worked as a strong team of four and produced what we believe to be a high standard design that is targeted very strongly to our target audience “Young parents with young children raising a new puppy”.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/Qdwx78Te6WmQCgeBBtXN2r/Pups-%26-Kids-App?node-id=1%3A3&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1"><strong>Click here</strong></a> to access the prototype for the ‘Pups & Kids app.</p>
        <h3><strong>Roadblocks</strong></h3>
        <p>Our biggest roadblock came when one of our team members exited the project without notice. They were tasked with researching some key components of our design including testing and risks. This prevented development of some of our desired features and slowed down the overall momentum and progress of the project. The team managed to come together as we did in A2 when another team member left without notice. We had a crisis meeting and redistributed the workload.</p>
         <h3><strong>Future Planning</strong></h3>
         <p>With the inital phase of the project complete, we will be handing the project onto a new team to develop, test and bring the final product to market.</p>
