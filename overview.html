    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <div class="margin-left">
      
      <p>During A2, we decided to work toward one of our team members A1 project idea. A car pool application that allowed people to car pool on trips beyond the metro area. We ended up naming it myCarPal.  Between the time we decided and started working on the project idea, the original creator and team member left the project without notice.&nbsp;We quickly realised, that the majority&nbsp;of us were not very passionate about the project,&nbsp;but we pushed on and completed A2. We were happy to learn that A3 provided us with an opportunity to go in a different direction and we decided to commence planning on a different project idea that was presented by another team member during A1. The idea was to create a puppy socialisation mobile application called Puppies & Nappies.  As we are all animal lovers, this was something we could all passionately get behind and so we proceeded with our new project direction.</p>
      <h1 id="Topic">Topic</h1>
       <p>Early on, the team decided to change the name of the application from Puppies &amp; Nappies to Pups &amp; Kids. The Pups &amp; Kids app is more than just a puppy socialising app. It's a personalised program that starts when you first adopt a puppy from places like the RSPCA or from a registered puppy breeder. It's a free program to encourage and educate families on properly raising the puppy to become a beloved, well-trained family member. While educating the parents and the children on the proper socialisation of the puppy as they work their way through the puppy's different developmental stages. It'll be a fun and creative adventure that the whole family can get involved in.</p>
<p>The team at OTOD Tech, aim to partner with some of Australia's leading animal welfare industries like the RSPCA, Save a Dog Scheme (SADS), Animals Australia and the Australian Veterinary Association (AVA), as well as Raising Children and more. These institutes are well known and trusted by the Australian public, and families will realise that the 'Pups &amp; Kids application is the best resource for their family and their puppy. The program and app not only help with the training but will also train the family on what the puppy needs to develop adequately throughout the first 16 weeks of age. After all, money can buy your family a fine dog, but love makes them wag their tail.</p>
