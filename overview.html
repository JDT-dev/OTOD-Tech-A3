    <h2>Project Overview</h2>

      <p>During A2, we decided to work toward one of our team members A1 project idea. A car pool application that allowed people to car pool on trips beyond the metro area. We ended up naming it myCarPal.  Between the time we decided and started working on the project idea, the original creator and team member left the project without notice.&nbsp;We quickly realised, that the majority&nbsp;of us were not very passionate about the project,&nbsp;but we pushed on and completed A2. We were happy to learn that A3 provided us with an opportunity to go in a different direction and we decided to commence planning on a different project idea that was presented by another team member during A1. The idea was to create a puppy socialisation mobile application called Puppies & Nappies.  As we are all animal lovers, this was something we could all passionately get behind and so we proceeded with our new project direction.</p>
      <h1 id="Topic">Topic</h1>
       <p>Early on, the team decided to change the name of the application from Puppies &amp; Nappies to Pups &amp; Kids. The Pups &amp; Kids app is more than just a puppy socialising app. It's a personalised program that starts when you first adopt a puppy from places like the RSPCA or from a registered puppy breeder. It's a free program to encourage and educate families on properly raising the puppy to become a beloved, well-trained family member. While educating the parents and the children on the proper socialisation of the puppy as they work their way through the puppy's different developmental stages. It'll be a fun and creative adventure that the whole family can get involved in.</p>
<p>The team at OTOD Tech, aim to partner with some of Australia's leading animal welfare industries like the RSPCA, Save a Dog Scheme (SADS), Animals Australia and the Australian Veterinary Association (AVA), as well as Raising Children and more. These institutes are well known and trusted by the Australian public, and families will realise that the 'Pups &amp; Kids application is the best resource for their family and their puppy. The program and app not only help with the training but will also train the family on what the puppy needs to develop adequately throughout the first 16 weeks of age. After all, money can buy your family a fine dog, but love makes them wag their tail.</p>

        Research conducted in 2012-2013 discovered that approximately 211,655
        dogs end up in pounds, and of that, approximately 43,900 are killed
        (21%). Let me state that again 43,900 are killed. That should shock
        you. Dogs are loving, compassionate beings that live in the moment and
        give nothing but unconditional love. We do not need to be killing so
        many innocent creatures. It's not the dogs' fault that they end up in
        that situation. It's ours due to our lack of knowledge around what a
        puppy needs early on in their life. That's our motivation, to equip
        families with the knowledge to prevent future deaths of dogs because of
        the lack of socialisation and training received during their formative
        years.

        It is obvious that parents need help in training their puppy while
        balancing their family. Encouraging parents to schedule and focus on
        the puppy’s needs during the first 16 weeks (“Critical period), will
        help create a strong foundation for when the puppy grows into an adult
        dog. By focusing on the interaction between a puppy and a child, this
        will help the parent and child realize that they have an affectionate,
        caring lifetime companion that truly is humanity's best friend. We owe
        it to puppies all around the world to try and help put an end to these
        heartbreaking and unfair statistics. The OTOD Tech Team are
        compassionate and empathetic people. Advocates for the vulnerable and
        those without a voice. That’s what we are passionate about. Every one
        of us are focussed on making the world a better place, in our own way,
        and if this app ever came to market, we’re sure it would be welcomed,
        by like-minded stakeholders, especially those in the non-for-profit /
        charity sector.

    With parents needing to focus on raising a toddler or young child, it can
    make the process of raising a puppy ten times harder. Without the required
    knowledge and training skills, this often results in frustration targeted
    at the puppy and the puppy being either rehomed or dumped in a pound later
    in life when behaviour issues begin to show. Some owners will attend a
    four-week puppy class, often held in vet clinics by unqualified trainers
    such as vet nurses. The classes tend to cover more vet related topics than
    behavioural needs and the importance of positive socialisation within the
    puppy's first 16 weeks of life. They also tend to advise owners not to take
    their puppies out of the home until they've had all three vaccinations,
    which is detrimental to the puppy's development. Then, by the time the
    puppy class is over, the puppy is beyond 16 weeks of age, and the Critical
    period is over. A puppy's ability to socialise efficiently and effectively,
    beyond this point, diminishes by the day. Parents may also turn to the
    different puppy training apps on the market, such as Puppy Training Chewy
    tips, Dog Training & Clicker and Pupford. These apps are good, but they
    all cost money, and when you look at them, they are focused on dog training
    but not so much on family training. It's essential that the app focuses on
    both the family and the puppy in a fun educational way.
